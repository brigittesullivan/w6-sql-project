# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)

## Process
### (your step 1)
### (your step 2)

1. Load Data
2. Explore and attempt starting with questions answers. As I answered the questions, I noted areas that needed to be cleaned. If I needed to clean right away (e.g., unitprice), I performed the cleaning within the query 
3. Write cleaning queries and execute into a 'clean' table (time permitting)
4. 

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

* Should focus streamline efforts on the USA market. Most revenue from this area. 
* Is it profitable to operate and ship to so many countries considering all costs of doing business ? 

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project
* difficult to get a sense of the data
* Data Quality - 
    * no clear primary keys 
    * data not normalized

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)

* complete re-organization of the database (see ppt slide)

## Assumptions
- unitcost product price 
- columns with the same name have same meaning/value
