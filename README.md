# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)

## Process
### (your step 1)
### (your step 2)

### Assumptions
- unit cost and product price are same
- columns with the same name have same meaning/value 
- visitid is the most unique identifier that can be used to join analytics and all_sessions

1. Load Data. Used online converter to take csv file and generate create table queries to avoid manually typing all column names and have seeded column data types. Where errors were returned, adjusted the data type accordingly so that the data would load completely and successfully. 
2. Explore and attempt starting with questions answers. As I answered the questions, I noted areas that needed to be cleaned. If I needed to clean right away (e.g., unitprice), I performed the cleaning within the query for the starting with questions. 
3. Write cleaning queries and execute into a 'clean' table (time permitting)
4. Document steps taken to do QA. QA is something out of habit that I do for every query. 

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

* Should focus streamline efforts on the USA market. Most revenue from this area. 


## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project
* difficult to get a sense of the data
* Data Quality - 
    * no clear primary keys 
    * data not normalized

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)

Data quality:
* complete re-organization of the database (see ppt slide), normalize the data. 

Cleaning: 
* create clean table versions for each table
* 

Analysis: 
* Is it profitable to operate and ship to so many countries considering all costs of doing business ?
